Attestation servers require a specific blob that is used to authenticate. The
content and format of the blob are determined by the particular attestation
server being used. There is no default value; you must supply the value as
specified by your attestation service. See the `attestation_server` help text
for more information about host verification.

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting
only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

Possible values:

* A string containing the specific blob required by the attestation server, or
  an empty string.

When using metrics to weight the suitability of a host, you can use this option
to change how the calculated weight influences the weight assigned to a host as
follows:

* >1.0: increases the effect of the metric on overall weight
* 1.0: no change to the calculated weight
* >0.0,<1.0: reduces the effect of the metric on overall weight
* 0.0: the metric value is ignored, and the value of the
  'weight_of_unavailable' option is returned instead
* >-1.0,<0.0: the effect is reduced and reversed
* -1.0: the effect is reversed
* <-1.0: the effect is increased proportionally and reversed

This setting specifies the metrics to be weighed and the relative ratios for
each metric. This should be a single string value, consisting of a series of
one or more 'name=ratio' pairs, separated by commas, where 'name' is the name
of the metric to be weighed, and 'ratio' is the relative weight for that
metric.

Note that if the ratio is set to 0, the metric value is ignored, and instead
the weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.

As an example, let's consider the case where this option is set to:

    ``name1=1.0, name2=-1.3``

The final weight will be:

    ``(name1.value * 1.0) + (name2.value * -1.3)``

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

Possible values:

* A list of zero or more key/value pairs separated by commas, where the key is
  a string representing the name of a metric and the value is a numeric weight
  for that metric. If any value is set to 0, the value is ignored and the
  weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.

This setting determines how any unavailable metrics are treated. If this option
is set to True, any hosts for which a metric is unavailable will raise an
exception, so it is recommended to also use the MetricFilter to filter out
those hosts before weighing.

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

Possible values:

* True or False, where False ensures any metric being unavailable for a host
  will set the host weight to 'weight_of_unavailable'.
